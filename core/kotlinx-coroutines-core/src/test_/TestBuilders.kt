/**
 * Executes a [testBody] in a [TestCoroutineScope] which provides detailed control over the execution of coroutines.
 *
 * This function should be used when you need detailed control over the execution of your test. For most tests consider
 * using [runBlockingTest].
 *
 * Code executed in a `asyncTest` will dispatch lazily. That means calling builders such as [launch] or [async] will
 * not execute the block immediately. You can use methods like [TestCoroutineScope.runCurrent] and
 * [TestCoroutineScope.advanceTimeTo] on the [TestCoroutineScope]. For a full list of execution methods see
 * [DelayController].
 *
 * ```
 * @Test
 * fun exampleTest() = asyncTest {
 *     // 1: launch will execute but not run the body
 *     launch  {
 *         // 3: the body of launch will execute in response to runCurrent [currentTime = 0ms]
 *         delay(1_000)
 *         // 5: After the time is advanced, delay(1_000) will return [currentTime = 1000ms]
 *         println("Faster delays!")
 *     }
 *
 *     // 2: use runCurrent() to execute the body of launch [currentTime = 0ms]
 *     runCurrent()
 *
 *     // 4: advance the dispatcher "time" by 1_000, which will resume after the delay
 *     advanceTimeTo(1_000)
 *
 * ```
 *
 * This method requires that all coroutines launched inside [testBody] complete, or are cancelled, as part of the test
 * conditions.
 *
 * In addition any unhandled exceptions thrown in coroutines must be rethrown by
 * [TestCoroutineScope.rethrowUncaughtCoroutineException] or cleared via [TestCoroutineScope.exceptions] inside of
 * [testBody].
 *
 * @throws UncompletedCoroutinesError If the [testBody] does not complete (or cancel) all coroutines that it launches
 * (including coroutines suspended on await).
 * @throws UnhandledExceptionsError If an uncaught exception is not handled by [testBody]
 *
 * @param dispatcher An optional dispatcher, during [testBody] execution [TestCoroutineDispatcher.dispatchImmediately] will be set to false
 * @param testBody The code of the unit-test.
 *
 * @see [runBlockingTest]

/**
 * Executes a [testBody] inside an immediate execution dispatcher.
 *
 * This is similar to [runBlocking] but it will immediately progress past delays and into [launch] and [async] blocks.
 * You can use this to write tests that execute in the presence of calls to [delay] without causing your test to take
 * extra time.
 *
 * Compared to [asyncTest], it provides a smaller API for tests that don't need detailed control over execution.
 *
 * ```
 * @Test
 * fun exampleTest() = runBlockingTest {
 *     val deferred = async {
 *         delay(1_000)
 *         async {
 *             delay(1_000)
 *         }.await()
 *     }
 *
 *     deferred.await() // result available immediately
 * }
 *
 * ```
 *
 * [runBlockingTest] will allow tests to finish successfully while started coroutines are unfinished. In addition unhandled
 * exceptions inside coroutines will not fail the test.
 *
 * @param dispatcher An optional dispatcher, during [testBody] execution [TestCoroutineDispatcher.dispatchImmediately] will be set to true
 * @param testBody The code of the unit-test.
